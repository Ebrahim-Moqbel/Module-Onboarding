          -how users can get started with the project
          -Where users can get help with your project
          -Who maintains and contributes to the project

        <h2>What is a branch in Git</h2>

        <h2>What is the purpose of wireframe </h2>
        <p>
          A wireframe is the skeleton of your digital project. Think of it as the foundation for your website, app, or dashboard. It focuses on layout, and content placement—not on colors, fonts, or any visual polish.
